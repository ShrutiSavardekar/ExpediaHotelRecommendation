# ExpediaHotelRecommendation
Team Project for CMPE 256

We are developing a Hybrid Collaborative Recommedation for Expedia Hotel. This hotel recommendation system will recommend a group of hotels to the users based on their prior actions or previous hotel bookings. The goal of this project is to predict the booking outcome (hotel cluster) for a user event, based on their search and other attributes associated with that user event.
